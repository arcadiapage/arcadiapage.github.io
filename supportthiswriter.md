Being a writer and independent creative can be a solitary journey, but knowing my work has meaning makes all the difference. Your support reminds me that I’m not creating into the void — that what I share truly matters.
Thank you for helping me to keep creating a space that inspires reflection, joy, and self-acceptance.
