Hello! I'm Arcadia Page, an intuitive writer, artist, and creative rebel⚡. Through my dreams, intuitive insights, and daily creative life, I share the experience of reconnecting to one's inner creative voice and universe. This space is also an invitation to slow down, let go of hustle, and to listen to natural rhythms.

Overall, my body of work is a forest full of all kinds of twisted paths, turns, and forks in the road. So dear explorer, here's your map. 

Go through this guide in order or run towards whatever calls to you, because this space is for wandering. 

Take your time. Start any where you want, anyway you want.

For me, creativity arrives in an endless flow.

Making with my hands energizes, refreshes, and transforms me.

Quiet is necessary if I really want to hear. Quiet is also necessary if I want to see. 

Anyone who I can sit with comfortably in quiet is a potential friend.

Feel free to whisper quiet dreams to [the wall of wishes.](https://arcadiapage.com/the-wishing-wall/)

A room of blue and white with inviting tables and cozy chairs. Here is stored a curated constellation of posts to get started with.🌌

<h1><a id="hall-of-fluttering">The Hall of Fluttering Leaves</a></h1>

Adjacent to the Quiet Room is a deeper space. Here my thoughts fly and flutter unhindered and even a bit unhinged--like newly released butterflies.

🍃Hear their random whispers...

> Sometimes during my writing sessions, I don't write much at all. Instead I simply sit and daydream, totally enraptured.

> The mirror is used to seeing the reflections of everyone else within itself. But what happens when the mirror finally sees and recognizes its own reflection in truth? It vibrates. It resonates. It sings. 

> I just realized that sometimes deciding to relax is the bravest thing I can do. So crazy. 

> When I'm feeling overwhelmed by options, it helps to remember that my inner child knows exactly what she wants--and doesn't want.

The red lotus blossoms.

I sit before the fire. Or maybe the fire is in me. In any case, I create before it. 

I create to remember. I remember, to create. My favorite CDs are on repeat. 

I don't fear strangeness. It is my blanket and my sword. I laugh as I wear my paper crown made of finest gold.
