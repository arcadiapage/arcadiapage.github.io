My name is Arcadia Page, and I'm an intuitive artist, writer & creative rebel.

In a world full of pressure to conform, I believe that fulfillment comes from trusting in my intuition and quirks. When we stop people-pleasing and create from the heart, that's when we become empowered and resourceful. This blog is my personal space for documenting and sharing my creative and intuitive life in a way that feels natural and unpressured. It's my goal for this to grow into a space where I can post whatever feels alive for me—be it thoughts on my creative process, raw moments of intuition, or snapshots of my day (even if they're messy or "ugly" by Instagram standards).

I'm following my inner creative compass and this is my journey—and I hope it inspires you. Here's what you can learn from me:

- How to add [self-care and healing](https://arcadiapage.com/2024-01-29-today-do-what-heals-you/) to your day, especially if you're sensitive and intuitive.

I've written many books, and they are [available for purchase](https://payhip.com/ArcadiaPage/collection/books) if they resonate with you. 

I'm best known for:

- And my ancient yet finished webcomic, [Mascara](https://ia801806.us.archive.org/33/items/smackjeeves-59912/59912/index.html#1) (It was saved from the sinking ship that was Smackjeeves to the Internet Archives by some awesome people. Thank you ❤️ Creating this comic was a lovely learning process that I'll never forget).
