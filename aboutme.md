My name is Arcadia Page, and I'm a artist/personal growth blogger who shares ideas on emotional health, creativity, simplicity and what it's like being an online entreprenuer. Here's what you can learn from me:

- How to be [productive with less stress and burnout and celebrate little wins.](https://arcadiapage.com/2023-10-31-Three-Essential-Steps-to-Better-Productivity-Highly-Sensitive-Person/) I'm all about [reaching goals the easy and fun way.](https://arcadiapage.com/2023-09-30-What-To-Do-When-Overthinking-Your-Goals/)
- How to work with [scattered thinking, inspiration and creative chaos.](https://arcadiapage.com/2023-10-31-Multipotentialite-You're-Not-As-Lost-As-You-Think/)
- How to add [self-care and healing](https://arcadiapage.com/2024-01-29-today-do-what-heals-you/) to your day, especially if you're sensitive and intuitive.
- If you're an INFP, [how to make the most of your personality type.](https://arcadiapage.com/2023-12-26-How-to-bring-your-INFP-Archetypes-into-Your-Everyday-Life/)
- If you're a writer, [how to create a writing practice that is fun, gentle, and productive.](https://arcadiapage.com/2024-01-29-being-a-productive-writer-does-not-have-to-be-painful/)

I love the process of building a creative, simple, healthy, and introspective life because I believe that is what leads to growth and joy. As a highly sensitive empath (and an INFP) I feel more empowered when I work from a place of compassion instead of stress.

I've written many books, and they are [available for purchase](https://payhip.com/ArcadiaPage/collection/books) if they resonate with you. 

I'm best known for [The Little Book of Tiny Tasks: Make Your Life More Calm While Getting Things Done 5 Minutes at a Time](https://payhip.com/b/e32lr), [Idealist Dreams: How I Learned to Plan as an INFP](https://payhip.com/b/KrBh), and my ancient yet finished webcomic, [Mascara](https://ia801806.us.archive.org/33/items/smackjeeves-59912/59912/index.html#1) (It was saved from the sinking ship that was Smackjeeves to the Internet Archives by some awesome people. Thank you ❤️ Creating this comic was a lovely learning process that I'll never forget).
