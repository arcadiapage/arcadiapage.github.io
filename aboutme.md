My body of work is a forest full of all kinds of twisted paths, turns, and forks in the road. So dear explorer, here's your map. 

Go through this guide in order or run towards whatever calls to you, because this space is for wandering. 

Take your time. Start any where you want, any way you want.

<h1><a id="fount-white-butterfly">Fount White Butterfly</a></h1>

For me, creativity arrives in an endless flow.

Making with my hands energizes, refreshes, and transforms me.

Quiet is necessary if I really want to hear. Quiet is also necessary if I want to see. 

Anyone who I can sit with comfortably in quiet is a potential friend.

<h1><a id="the-starlight-library">The Starlight Library</a></h1>

This is my deeper archive and supporter space where I share some of my audio journals and wanderings before they land on my blog. 

If you wish to take some of my more unexpected and spontaneous creations with you, then give the [Starlight Library](https://payhip.com/b/ROPCQ) a look.

üíøHere are some audio excerpts from the library:

<h1><a id="hall-of-fluttering">The Avila Room: The Hall of Fluttering Leaves</a></h1>

Within the Avila Room is a deeper space. Here my thoughts fly and flutter unhindered and even a bit unhinged--like newly released butterflies.

üçÉHear their random whispers...

> Sometimes during my writing sessions, I don't write much at all. Instead I simply sit and daydream, totally enraptured.

> The mirror is used to seeing the reflections of everyone else within itself. But what happens when the mirror finally sees and recognizes its own reflection in truth? It vibrates. It resonates. It sings. 

> I just realized that sometimes deciding to relax is the bravest thing I can do. So crazy. 

> When I'm feeling overwhelmed by options, it helps to remember that my inner child knows exactly what she wants--and doesn't want.

The red lotus blossoms.

I sit before the fire. Or maybe the fire is in me. In any case, I create before it. 

I create to remember. I remember, to create. My favorite CDs are on repeat. 

I don't fear strangeness. It is my blanket and my sword. I laugh as I wear my paper crown made of finest gold.
