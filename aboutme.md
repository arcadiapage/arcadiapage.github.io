My name is Arcadia Page, and I'm an intuitive artist/writer. I create  stories, art, and reflections that bubble up from my intuition, helping others to see things from new perspectives.

My work invites people to reflect, grow, and discover new insights about themselves and the world around them. It's flawed, imperfect, and messy sometimes, much like the nature of love. Here's what you can learn from me:

- How to be [productive with less stress and burnout and celebrate little wins.](https://arcadiapage.com/2023-10-31-Three-Essential-Steps-to-Better-Productivity-Highly-Sensitive-Person/) I'm all about [reaching goals the easy and fun way.](https://arcadiapage.com/2023-09-30-What-To-Do-When-Overthinking-Your-Goals/)
- How to work with [scattered thinking, inspiration and creative chaos.](https://arcadiapage.com/2023-10-31-Multipotentialite-You're-Not-As-Lost-As-You-Think/)
- How to add [self-care and healing](https://arcadiapage.com/2024-01-29-today-do-what-heals-you/) to your day, especially if you're sensitive and intuitive.
- If you're an INFP, [how to make the most of your personality type.](https://arcadiapage.com/2023-12-26-How-to-bring-your-INFP-Archetypes-into-Your-Everyday-Life/)
- If you're a writer, [how to create a writing practice that is fun, gentle, and productive.](https://arcadiapage.com/2024-01-29-being-a-productive-writer-does-not-have-to-be-painful/)

You can also learn more about what I do by reading this interview I did with [Canvas Rebel](https://canvasrebel.com/meet-arcadia-page/). 

I love the process of building a creative, simple, healthy, and introspective life because I believe that is what leads to growth and joy. As a neurodivergent writer living with chronic pain, I feel more empowered when I work from a place of compassion instead of stress.

I've written many books, and they are [available for purchase](https://payhip.com/ArcadiaPage/collection/books) if they resonate with you. 

I'm best known for:

- [The Little Book of Tiny Tasks: Make Your Life More Calm While Getting Things Done 5 Minutes at a Time](https://payhip.com/b/e32lr)
- [I Want to Do All the Things: Finding Balance as a Polymath, Multipotentialite & Renaissance Soul](https://payhip.com/b/4ljG)
- [Idealist Dreams: How I Learned to Plan as an INFP](https://payhip.com/b/KrBh)
- And my ancient yet finished webcomic, [Mascara](https://ia801806.us.archive.org/33/items/smackjeeves-59912/59912/index.html#1) (It was saved from the sinking ship that was Smackjeeves to the Internet Archives by some awesome people. Thank you ❤️ Creating this comic was a lovely learning process that I'll never forget).
