My name is Arcadia Page. Currently I'm best known for my book, "[Idealist Dreams: How I Learned to Plan as an INFP](https://arcadiapage.itch.io/idealist-dreams)" and my finished webcomic, "[Mascara](https://www.smackjeeves.com/discover/detail?titleNo=59912&articleNo=1)."

I'm also known for writing articles about INFPs, writing, productivity, and the creative life.

I am a fan of Japanese culture, an aspiring minimalist, and have this hopelessly nerdy side that's not afraid to play with code and is fascinated by the Raspberry Pi.
