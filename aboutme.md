My name is Arcadia Page. I'm best known for my books, [Idealist Dreams: How I Learned to Plan as an INFP](https://payhip.com/b/KrBh),   [I Can’t Help Being an INFP Writer](https://payhip.com/b/4tWM), and my ancient yet finished webcomic, [Mascara](https://ia801806.us.archive.org/33/items/smackjeeves-59912/59912/index.html#1) (It was recently saved from the sinking ship that was Smackjeeves to the Internet Archives by some awesome people. Thank you ❤️ Creating this comic was a lovely learning process that I'll never forget).

I also write articles that encourage sensitive, creative, and intuitive individuals to understand themselves and utilize the best of their abilities.

I am an Asian culture addict, an aspiring minimalist, and have this hopelessly nerdy side that's not afraid to play with code and enjoys tinkering with technology.
