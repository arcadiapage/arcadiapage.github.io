So [Last month](https://arcadiapage.com/2020-09-19-how-to-build-a-planner-from-scratch/) I shared how I had to rebuild my planner from the ground up to accommodate some of the major changes in my life. 

Since that post, I've streamlined what I started with to the essentials. 



The big picture of my planner is organized like this:

1. **One yearly goal.** If I reach my yearly goal before the end of the year, I'm allowing myself to set another one. But I only take on one goal at a time.
2. **One weekly goal based on my yearly goal.** I ask myself the question, "What can I do this week to keep me on track with my yearly goal?"
3. **One daily goal based on my weekly goal. ** What can I do today to keep myself on track with my weekly goal. 

In addition to my daily goal, I also write 3 Must Do items. These items either come from my calendar or from my weekly reminders list. These are things that MUST be done today or suffer the consequences.  At the bottom of my list, I also include my daily habits so I don't forget them. 

Then after that I'm free to add any notes or tasks to that come to my mind throughout out the day. 

At the end of the day, I type my notes into the appropriate files on my computer, and move the tasks that I thought of to my calendar (if they're time sensitive) or to my weekly reminders list. 

I also have a single page dedicated to keeping track of tasks for my four writing projects. Two projects on one side and two projects on the other. And that's pretty much it. 

I have a habit tracker for the week at the start of my weekly list, but I feel that isn't necessary. I also like setting a theme for each week based on archetypes that I identify with such as the Idealist, Healer, or Sage. There are plenty of other archetypes on my list. The cool thing about using archetypes to set the theme for the week is that doing so helps me to get into the right mindset for whatever I need to accomplish for the week. 

So, enough writing from me!

Here's the video tour of my new planner set-up.
