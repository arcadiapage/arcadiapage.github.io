As an introvert, I enjoy using tools that encourage deep reflection on my life and myself. Of course, writing in my journal is my main go-to, but sometimes it's necessary to mix things up a little. So here are a few resources that I've encountered recently that have added some imaginative spice to my typical introspective practices.

# [Betwixt](https://www.betwixt.life/)

Betwixt is the best mental health app I have ever used. It is a beautiful text-based narrative RPG where you are a character in a fantasy world. As you travel the world and take on various challenges, you learn more about yourself and how you can use your unique skills to build supportive emotional habits in the real world.

I love the immersive settings created in this app, and I also appreciate how it doesn’t bug you to build a habit or do it every day. Instead it uses the power of good storytelling, and I feel that this was a much more effective way of bringing me back to the app. 

# [This Girl’s Got Game](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ThisGirlsGotGame?ref=shop-header-name&listing_id=1696512704&from_page=listing)

I can say that this Etsy shop has changed my life without any exaggeration. The printables are beautiful, easy to print, and transformational. I’ve enjoyed printing out the pages of different workbooks and using them to create a customized collection of worksheets and prompts that meet my needs.  

My favorite workbooks from this shop are [The Queen of Vision](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1562431913/vision-journal-goal-setting-planner?click_key=1169102a9ae36bb79230e56ca9b1032b4f7dbcec%3A1562431913&click_sum=9ddb4148&ga_search_query=vision&ref=shop_items_search_1&pro=1), [The Queen of Adaptability](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1532713480/adaptability-journal-self-discovery?click_key=0f4a2ebc130fa3d2f2bf54c44dd0f1bc64ccfb00%3A1532713480&click_sum=54342335&ga_search_query=Queen&ref=shop_items_search_4&pro=1), and the [Feminine Archetypes Collection](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1534942280/devine-feminine-energy-female-archetype?click_key=4ac448379ea895fc16a4210a442e243203b99f03%3A1534942280&click_sum=1e6802ec&ga_search_query=Archetypes&ref=shop_items_search_1&pro=1). I’ve used these printables to find more clarity on how I run my creative business and approach my life. Personally, I’ve struggled a lot with accepting the parts of myself that identify with The Innocent and The Mother archetypes, so the workbooks were helpful in learning to appreciate the strengths of these archetypes. Workbooks for each archetype can be purchased separately if you don't want the collection. 

# Honorable Mentions

Betwixt and the printables from This Girl’s Got Game are my top favorites, but here are a couple of other resources that I‘ve really appreciated.

**[Shuffles by Pinterest](https://www.shffls.com/):** This app is still in beta, but it’s such a cool and easy way to make digital vision boards and mood boards that you can set as your wallpaper or share with others. 

**[Univi](https://www.univi.app/):** This is an app designed to help those suffering from ADHD learn organizational skills. But what I like the most about this app is the AI for creating customized guided visualizations that you can listen to. I was surprised at how comforting and impactful the visualizations were. 

Both of these apps create a unique way to explore the more visual side of introspection. Shuffles can be used to easily create collages of your feelings and dreams without cutting up any magazines, and Univi can create short but meaningful visualization journeys that have a positive emotional impact.

So these are my favorite imaginative personal growth resources for introverts. I really appreciate how all of these resources encourage use of your own creativity and imagination to learn more about yourself.
