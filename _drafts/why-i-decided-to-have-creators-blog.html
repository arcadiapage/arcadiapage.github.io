<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>The main difference between an author blog/creator blog and a business blog are the goals they have.<br /><br />Not knowing this has sent me in circles on how to approach my blog. Really, I just love blogging. I don't care if it's monetized or not, and although it would be nice to have a blog that's widely read, that's not something that keeps me up at night. However, the thing is, it is necessary to have some goals for your blog or else <b>it can start feeling a bit pointless</b>.&nbsp; And knowing the difference between the two is essential for setting goals.<br /><br />Most blogging advice out there is for business blogs. So you may run into the situation where mentally you think, "I have an author blog," or "I have an artist blog," but you end up running it like a business blog. I've been there way too often and following advice on how to blog from business blogs has caused me to make some ugly missteps.<br /><br />To rediscover the goals of my blog I had to ask myself, is this a business blog or a creator blog? <i>And what's the difference between the two?</i><br /><br />Here's what I'm discovering:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bN1JsZCX0GE/W8iU9A4hSkI/AAAAAAAAEQ0/9PigNJrIEY4jXUWV_zOkejfR-ADtH3rKgCEwYBhgL/s1600/9.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1102" data-original-width="735" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bN1JsZCX0GE/W8iU9A4hSkI/AAAAAAAAEQ0/9PigNJrIEY4jXUWV_zOkejfR-ADtH3rKgCEwYBhgL/s1600/9.png" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>Business blog:&nbsp;</b>Focused on selling to readers. Creates relationships with readers for the purpose of selling products to them later. Blog is focused on converting newcomers to buyers.<br /><br />Blogs like these typically employ sales funnels and email newsletters designed to sell you their latest book, course, etc... With a business blog, the blog is number one. The goal is to publish articles often and to get posts out there because that's how these blogs attract new people. Their purpose is sell to people from the blog.<br /><br /><h3><b>So what makes an author or creator blog different?</b></h3><b><br /></b>I've done a bit of research lately on what exactly a creator blog is, because like I've mentioned, the majority of blogging advice is about getting bigger and gaining more and more reach--which is okay if your blog is your business. A creator blog can also gain more reach, but for a creator blog, that's not the big picture.<br /><br /><b>A creator blog (I'm using this term from here on, because authors and artists are creators) is focused on connecting with people who already enjoy what the creator is creating. </b>It may appeal to newcomers, but it's not mainly for them.<br /><br />For a creator, the blog is not the business. The novels or art or whatever they're making is the business. The goal of blogging is to share more of yourself with people who already enjoy what you make so that they can have a closer relationship with the sources of your work.<br /><br />If someone who enjoys your work wants to see everything you have published, they can go to the page on your blog where you have listed all of your books, your gallery, or whatever they enjoy that comes from you. In fact, with this kind of audience, that most likely will be the first page they visit when they land on your blog.<br /><br />A creator's blog can sell, but unlike a business blog, it is not designed for in-your-face selling. Sales funnels are not necessary, and email newsletters may not be as important since you're sharing updates to your audience via your blog.<br /><br /><b>A creator's blog is for people who are already invested in your work.</b> There's no need to try hard to sell to them because they most likely have already bought your books, art, music, etc... These people don't need to be captured by pop-up email sign up forms because they've already been captured by the beauty of your work.<br /><br /><h3><b>There's a focus on the next project, not the blog.</b></h3><br />In fiction writing circles, a piece of advice that's becoming more popular is, "Your novel is first, promotion is second. And writing another novel is one of the best ways to promote yourself." Since the purpose of a creator's blog is to connect with those who enjoy your work, you can post less often than a business blog. In her book <i>The Author Blog</i>, Anne R. Allen suggests posting once a week at the most. Although I am experimenting with new posting methods, typically I only post twice a month.<br /><br />If you would like to have a creator's blog, but you haven't published any kind of work yet, go back and focus on your work. Create art, write stories, freely share it and publish it. Then once you have a following on social media or other sites, come back and create a blog for your audience.<br /><br /><h3><b>What kinds of posts are published to a creator's blog?</b></h3><br />Business blogs are all about writing that fits into a specific topic or niche because they are trying to sell related products on their blog.<br /><br />On the other hand, creators are getting in touch with those who already have bought into what they make. The audience wants to learn more about the inspiration, work, and mindset behind the process.<br /><br />I like to imagine my blog posts as questions being asked to me from people who have encountered my work.<br /><br />For example, I imagine readers might ask me, "How do you create comics?"<br /><br />So then I write a blog post how to create comics.<br /><br />Currently I'm dealing with questions like, "How do you create without getting overwhelmed, since you're a sensitive intuitive introvert?" or "How have you learned to plan your time as an INFP, since INFPs are known for disorder?"<br /><br />Then I write blog posts answering those questions. So imagine what your readers would like to know. What questions would they ask you about your process, inspiration or your life? Write those questions down and then answer them. The answers are your blog posts.<br /><h3><br /><b>Setting Goals</b></h3><br />If this was a business blog, my goals would be about conversions and sign up numbers. However, from the way I've approached this post, it's obvious that my aim is to have a creator blog. So my goals are things like:<br /><br /><br /><ul><li>Add links to my blog where ever I share my stories, art, and publish books so people who enjoy my work can learn more about what I do.&nbsp;</li><li>Keep my published work page on my blog updated. (Very important!)</li><li>Share and publish more of my work so that more people can find my blog.&nbsp;</li><li>Share my articles with people who I think could be helped by what I write.&nbsp;</li><li>And this is a tall order but, I would love to post when ever I have something I have to share, not just posting for the sake of posting. Some weeks, I have multiple blog articles that I would like to post, but I hold back a bit more than I would like just because I want to stick to the schedule.</li></ul><br /><br />Of course, this is all a work in progress. I'm still learning how to integrate blogging into my creative workflow. I'm not the type who typically blogs about blogging, but I had to get this off my chest. <br /><br />So are you writer or an artist? If so, how do you feel about blogging?<br /><div><br /></div>
