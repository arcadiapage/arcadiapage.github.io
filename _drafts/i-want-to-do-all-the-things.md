Want a preview?

Much of the first chapter of this book was taken from my blog post, [Project Decluttering for Polymaths and Multipotentialites.](https://arcadiapage.com/2020-07-02-reducing-polymath-and-multipotentialite-project-overload/)

I've also recorded a virutal book reading!

This book totally took me by surprise! It started as a blog post and turned into a short, impactful ebook. I hope that you find the tips in it encouraging and helpful when it comes to managing and sharing a variety of interests and talents.
