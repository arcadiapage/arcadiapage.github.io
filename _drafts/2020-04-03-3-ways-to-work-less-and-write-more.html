As writers, it seems like we're engaged in a never-ending fight with the Day Job. Ever since I was five, I dreamed of being a working author. I could create stories and books for others to enjoy and that would be my job.<br /><br />Now I'm at a point where I'm making more income from writing than I ever have, but it's still pocket money. Although <a href="https://personalityjunkie.com/10/day-job-artists-creative-types/">there are perks to having a day job</a>, I'm not averse to reducing how much I depend on it. For the longest time, the gap between the money I make from writing and what it takes to live seemed too big.<br /><br />But a few months ago, my husband and I made some changes to the way we spend money, and now we are living on around 40%-50% of our income, more or less. We'll be close to fully paying off any debt we have early summer of next year. It will no longer be necessary for me to work for my current job, and he can reduce his work to two days a week.<br /><br />I've come to appreciate that with some basic lifestyle changes, I can put writing for a living within reach. I can work less and have more time for doing what I like. Also, thanks to these changes, the little bit of money I earn from writing has more of a household impact.<br /><br />If you want to make a living working as a writer or an artist, or if you are already working as an artist and are still having trouble with making ends meet, this post will be super helpful for you. You may find that the spending expectations of society are the only thing standing between you and working as an artist.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-d0pZzKcO7SE/XmpL_TPS25I/AAAAAAAAEw0/tCtI03DDfDwt8jKdA0LlLBYKBDq4R11MgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/the%2Bperfect%2Bpinterest%2Bpin%25281%2529.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1102" data-original-width="735" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-d0pZzKcO7SE/XmpL_TPS25I/AAAAAAAAEw0/tCtI03DDfDwt8jKdA0LlLBYKBDq4R11MgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/the%2Bperfect%2Bpinterest%2Bpin%25281%2529.png" /></a></div><br /><br />However, I have one disclaimer. I am in no way supporting the idea that you need to have all the free time in the world to write. It's important to write whenever you can. If you're not writing now when your life is busy, it's unlikely that reducing your workload will make you more successful. But for those who are already writing and who want to start living off of a writer's income, this is for you.<br /><br />Here is a rundown of how you can align your lifestyle so that writing full time is within reach. And don't worry, even living at 50% of our $30,000 income, my husband and I have enough money for Amazon Prime, Netflix and the occasional movie at the theater. This isn't a life of being in the dark ages, but it is a life of simplicity, balance, and setting limits.<br /><br />Living an inexpensive and fulfilling life is easier than you think, especially if you live in a Western Society. It's amazing what you can do. Just keep an open mind and an experimental attitude.<br /><br /><h1 id="step-1:-see-where-the-money-is-going">Step 1: See where the Money is Going</h1>Make a list of all the places that you can remember shopping over the past year. Then look them up in your bank account. Filter your search so that you can see a year's worth of spending for a single retailer. Calculate the total and write it down. Then look up the next retailer on your list. You may also want to note what category of spending that retailer usually falls under, such as food, clothing, house supplies, etc. It's okay if your totals are rough and not exact.<br /><br />When doing this, some imbalances will pop out at you. For example, I noticed that I had spent $500 on ebooks at Amazon. There's nothing wrong with buying the occasional ebook here and there, but I quickly saw that $500 is way out of balance for our income.<br /><br />After coming up with your totals, take time to compare your spending with someone who has way better spending habits than you. If you don't know anyone personally, I suggest starting with this eye-opening post from <a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2015/01/16/exposed-the-mmm-familys-2014-spending/">Mr. Money Mustache</a>. Take a close look at his spreadsheet and compare categories. Yes, it's from 2014, but I can tell you from personal experience, it still works. Do you see any ways that you can be more balanced with your spending? Note any ideas of how to get your spending more closely aligned with his and keep an eye out for areas of overspending.<br /><br />When you spot where you are overspending, make a note of how much you would prefer to spend. Then plan to monitor that from now on.<br /><br />For me, book spending is the area to keep an eye on. I used to get emails from Bookbub. Although it was great knowing what was on sale, in the long run, those sales were not saving me money. In fact, it was the number one contributor to my $500 ebook bill. So I unsubscribed. Now I just check the site once in a while to see if there is anything I would enjoy.<br /><br /><b>Here are more practical ways to reduce overspending:</b><br /><ul id="draft_check_box_list_0"><li>If you get ads from retailers that encourage you to spend too much, unsubscribe from them.  Searching to see if something you need is on sale saves you money, but getting alerts for every discount that's available actually causes you to spend more. Getting sales notifications does NOT help you save money. </li><li>If there is a website where you spend too much, set a time limit on it with a site blocker. I like using <a href="https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/">Leechblock</a> to limit my time on Amazon. Also using an ad-blocker, like <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm">Ublock Orgin</a>, can help you save money and give yourself a much better internet browsing experience. </li><li>If there is a physical store where you tend to spend too much, see if they have a ship-to-store option, so you can pick up what you need and avoid browsing. I do this with Target.</li><li>Ask yourself, "Do I really need to shop at this store at all?" Stores that I've removed from my regular shopping trips: Hobby Lobby and Publix (this is the fancy grocery store in my area). I've reduced shopping at these places to a few times out of the year. </li><li>If clothes are your weakness, check out <a href="https://bemorewithless.com/project-333/">The 333 Project</a>. I also recommend reading <b>The Wonderful World of Fifi Lapin</b>, by Fifi Lapin. Personal style has little to do with your income. </li></ul><h1 id="step-2:-question-everything">Step 2: Question Everything</h1>In Western Culture it's easy to have an "I need it, I want it, I'll buy it" mindset. It can become a subconscious habit. But to slow down that automatic response, you may want to ask yourself some questions before you hand over your money.<br /><br /><b>Before you buy, ask yourself:</b> <br /><ul id="draft_check_box_list_1"><li>Can I do without it? If I didn't have it, what would I do instead? Is the alternative that bad? </li><li>Can I live with less of that? Can I buy that less often?</li><li>Can I borrow it? Is buying it used just as fine?</li><li>Do I really need to spend x amount of money on that? Or can I find it at a discount?</li><li>Can I do what I've always done less expensively?</li></ul>You may want to write these questions down or print them out, so you can keep them as an easy reference.<br /><br />Here's are some more specific questions that I came across as I was questioning my spending habits: <br /><ul id="draft_check_box_list_2"><li>Do I really need to buy books?</li><li>Do I really need to buy coffee at the coffee shop?</li><li>Do I really need to drink coffee as often as I do?</li><li>Do I really need coffee at all?</li><li>Do I really need to go out to see this movie? Or is watching it at home fine?</li><li>Can I do without this kitchen gadget?</li><li>Do I really need to spend x amount of money on makeup?</li><li>Can I skip eating out today?</li></ul>Some things I've discovered as a result of my questioning:<br /><ul id="draft_check_box_list_3"><li>I can make a fantastic pour-over coffee at home. Doing my own version of the <a href="https://stories.starbucks.com/stories/2016/caffe-misto-vs-latte/">Misto from Starbucks</a> is my favorite. And I can get by fine without having coffee every day.</li><li>I don't need to buy books. My local library is more than adequate, and I earn ebook credits thanks to selecting slow shipping from Amazon Prime. Also Amazon Prime has a nice selection of free ebooks. And there is something beautiful about taking the time to reread books that I already own and reading my own writing. </li><li>With some research, it's possible to find inexpensive makeup that looks great. And I'm okay with wearing less make-up in general. </li><li><a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-can-i-turn-my-boring-digs-into-an-awesome-well-des-5888862">I don't need to spend much on home decor</a>. </li><li>My husband and I don't need to eat out every week. Once a month is fine. </li></ul>Try making an unwish-list. This is a wish-list of items that you DON'T need or can do with less of.<br /><br />Also try building appreciation for items that are worn and used. I'm not talking about holding on to things that need to go in the trash. I'm talking about appreciating items that are still usable that display history or character. The keyboard with the worn out keys. The t-shirt with the gently fading print. The desk with the slightly banged corners. Think about what you've experienced with those items. Do you really need to buy something shiny and new right now? Are things fine the way they are?<br /><h1 id="step-3:-spend-less-on-food">&nbsp;</h1><h1 id="step-3:-spend-less-on-food">Step 3: Spend Less on Food</h1>Grocery and food tend to be one of the highest household expenses. Last year, my husband and I spent $150 on pizza. In an earlier attempt to reduce spending, I read <b>The No Spend Challenge Guide</b> by Jen Smith. She suggested grocery shopping at low-cost grocery stores, such as Aldi or Walmart.<br /><br />I pass Aldi on my commute to work, so it was a good option. At first, I was a little wary. I had been at Aldi a few years back, and I found it kind of weird. However, I decided to give it another try. I did an internet search on "How to shop at Aldi," and I found good advice on how to navigate the store.<br /><br />So now I shop at Aldi every week, and I enjoy it. They have a variety of healthy food options (I'm currently gluten-free, sugar-free, dairy-free). We have saved hundreds of dollars monthly.<br /><br />One thing I've learned is to not rely on sales papers to tell me what to buy. Instead, I focus on making meals with simple, inexpensive ingredients. When the ingredients are inexpensive across the board, it's easy to save on groceries regardless of where you shop.<br /><br />If you're looking for recipes that are fast, inexpensive, and healthy, I highly recommend checking out the blog of <a href="https://cookingonabootstrap.com/">Jack Monroe</a>. Combining her recipes with shopping at a low-cost grocery store is a sure way to significantly reduce your grocery bill. I can find most of the ingredients for her recipes at Aldi.<br /><br />Since her site is British, <a href="https://www.errenskitchen.com/cooking-conversions/cups-to-grams-and-oz/">American readers may find this conversion chart helpful</a>. Canned items in her recipes can be replaced with fresh if you wish. If you need to add meat to a vegetarian dish, I've found it works well when I add chicken to recipes with chickpeas and black beans, and beef to recipes with kidney beans and baked beans. Play around and see what you come up with. Her recipes are flexible, and soon you'll find yourself eating at home more, getting creative in the kitchen, and wasting less food overall.<br /><br /><h2 id="splurge-once-in-a-while">Splurge Once in a while</h2>Currently, I'm a bit obsessed with buying a $16.00 bag of locally roasted coffee. I probably will indulge in that. But even so, that doesn't mean that I will buy that kind of coffee every month. Most of the time, the $6.00 bag of coffee is fine for me. So when thinking about getting something that's an upgrade, make it a special event. Don't be afraid to enjoy some luxury, but you don't have to do it every week. A few times a year is just as good.<br /><br /><h1 id="bonus:-handmade-is-the-new-luxury">Bonus: Handmade is the New Luxury</h1>Etsy is a popular place to enjoy handmade goods. Even Amazon had to join the handmade party with its "Amazon Handmade" store. People appreciate items that are made by hand because they show love, care, and skill.<br /><br />When trying to save money, often creating things by hand will come out cheaper. But, some handmade projects are time-consuming. Also if you're knitting or sewing, it can be more expensive than buying the item already made. But I think even if making something by hand takes more time or costs more money, it's still worth the effort.<br /><br /><b>Going handmade helps you to:</b><br /><ul id="draft_check_box_list_4"><li>Learn a new skill. That is priceless. </li><li>Be more mindful of the craftsmanship that goes into items you own. </li><li>Let go of a throw-away mindset. If you spent hours making something yourself, will you be tempted to quickly swap it out for something newer and better? Probably not. </li><li>Have the ability to repair your items. If you made it, it's easier to fix it. </li><li>Grow in self-confidence</li></ul>So here are a few areas where you can try making it by hand.<br /><br /><b>Cook for yourself.</b> Now that I've shared with you Jack Monroe's site, cooking for yourself will be a breeze. Her recipes are so easy to throw together, that it's helped my husband and me to eat out less. I can put together a whole meal from start to finish in 30 minutes. Fast food can wait. Also once you learn how to cook for yourself, you can cook for your friends, saving money from eating out and being more personal than going to a restaurant.<br /><br /><b>DIY Household Supplies.</b> Household supplies, especially organic ones can be expensive. However, it's easy to make your own at the fraction of the cost. I recommend checking out the book <b>Essential Glow</b> by Stephanie Gerber. You can also find great recipes for handmade cleaners and beauty products on the <a href="https://helloglow.co/">Hello Glow blog</a>.<br /><br /><b>Sewing.</b> Sewing can help you take control of your wardrobe. If you need to save money on sewing projects, I recommend upcycling from thrift stores or shopping for clothes from the discount rack that are easily altered. My favorite easy sewing books: <b>Sewing in a Straight Line</b> by Brett Bara and <b>The Chick Girls Guide to a One-of-a-Kind Wardrobe</b> by Kristina Clemens.<br /><br />Weaving and gardening are some other great DIY outlets to look into. If you learn how to garden well, you could reduce your grocery costs. If you're bad at knitting, learning how to weave is a great way to learn how to create textiles for home decor and household items.<br /><br />Going handmade is more than only arts &amp; crafts. Do you have any services that you tend to hire out for such as lawn care or cleaning? Try doing them yourself instead. I know not hiring a house cleaner may seem like it's taking more time away from your writing, but think about it this way.<br /><br />To pay for that lawn care service or house cleaner, you will need to work longer hours at your job or will have to make more money from your art. If you let go of those things, you can work more at home and be in closer proximity to your writing. If you're already an earning writer, it will lower the bar of what you need to earn to create a livable income. If you lower the bar of your income, it will relieve the pressure of creating and selling enough work.<br /><br />When it comes to the writing process, if you find yourself struggling with focus, take a break to do some crafting, cooking, or gardening. I've found that taking a break to create with my hands or doing physical activity helps me to settle my mind and regain my focus.<br /><br /><b>Questions to think about: </b><br /><ul id="draft_check_box_list_5"><li>Can I make or do this myself?</li><li>What can I do to make items last longer? </li></ul><h1 id="reaping-the-rewards">Reaping the Rewards</h1>After following these tips, you will find yourself with some extra income. You may even discover that you don't need to work as much at your job as you thought. If you can live well on less, reduce your work at your day job. Don't be shy. Do it.<br /><br />Overall, this simplifying isn't only about creating more time to do what you like. When you're starting out as a writer or an artist, you're not going to make much money. Living a simple and fulfilling lifestyle will make those early profits go further. Also, your earning goals will fall into a totally reachable range. How exciting is that?<br /><br /><h1 id="other-recommended-resources">Other Recommended Resources</h1><ul id="draft_check_box_list_6"><li>Cookbooks to reduce eating out: <b>The Mason Jar Cookbook</b> by Amy Fazio, <b>Real Simple Meals Made Easy</b> by Renee Schettler.</li><li>Going Handmade: <b>Made by Hand</b> by Maria Alexandra &amp; Stephanie Congdon Barnes, <b>Hello Tokyo</b> by Ebony Bizys, <a href="https://abeautifulmess.com/">A Beautiful Mess</a> blog. </li><li>Services that will save money on your phone bill: <a href="https://z60ggs9jt321.ting.com/">Ting</a> (Note: This link will give you a $25 credit!), <a href="https://fi.google.com/about/">GoogleFi</a> </li><li>My favorite online savings account service: <a href="https://www.smartypig.com/">Smarty Pig</a></li></ul><br /><a href="https://tinyletter.com/arcadiapage" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: large;">Want to be alerted of new posts?
