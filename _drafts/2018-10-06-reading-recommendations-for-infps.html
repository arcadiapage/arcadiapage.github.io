As an INFP, reading is one of my favorite ways to relax. Not only do I love enjoying some fun fiction or a graphic novel, but I also enjoy reading things that help me to learn a little more about myself. Below are my favorite books that are about or are related to living life as an INFP.<br /><br />I've sort of listed these books in order. The first few books are about learning what it means to be an INFP. Next are a few more books about self discovery that may appeal to INFPs, and the last few books are about creative and emotional challenges that INFPs may face.<br /><br /><br /><h3><b>The Comprehensive INFP Survival Guide by Heidi Priebe</b></h3><br />This is a good overview of the cognitive functions of INFPs and what all of that means. I like the book written by Priebe on ENFPs a slight bit more, but this book is still quite good. And I like the reminder at the end of the book that INFPs are needed in the world, and what we feel and think matters.<br /><br /><h3><b>Was that Really Me? by Naomi Quenk&nbsp;</b></h3><br />After the introduction, it's time to dig a bit deeper. This book goes into the role that inferior functions play in different personality types for better or worse. From this book I learned how much of impact my inferior extroverted thinking can have on me.<br /><br /><h3><b>Tranquility by Type by Susan Storm</b></h3><br />After learning about inferior functions, this book is a good follow up. It's short and to the point, but I found the section on dealing with stress as an INFP more helpful than I expected. I have a whole new view of my stop-and-go action when it comes to taking on personal projects.<br /><br /><h3><b>The Highly Sensitive Person by Dr. Elaine Aron&nbsp;</b></h3><br />Not all INFPs are highly sensitive, but many are. If you're often overwhelmed by sounds, smells or textures, or you are often deeply moved by art and nature, you may be highly sensitive. <a href="http://hsperson.com/test/" target="_blank">Take the HSP questionnaire to see if this book is for you</a>. Finding out about my high sensitivity has helped me to make my environment less draining, and I've learned that half of what I thought was social anxiety was actually over-stimulation. As a high sensation seeking HSP, I also learned why is so important for me to add more peace and quiet space to my day.<br /><br /><h3><b>Quiet by Susan Cain</b></h3><br />Speaking of draining verses quiet space...This book is a good reminder that it's okay to leave social events early and use solitude for reflection. And that solitude and reflection can be one hundred percent enjoyable. I like this book because it reminds me of what's great about being an introvert.<br /><br /><h3><b>Start Where You Are by</b></h3><br />While recovering from your introvert hangover in solitude, do some reflective journaling exercises from this book. I really enjoyed this book's approach to self reflection and discovery with it's combination of beautiful art and simple drawing and writing exercises. And if you're struggling with reaching goals, this book is a good place to start analyzing your expectations.<br /><br /><h3><b>The Journal Writing Super Power Secret by Michael Forest</b></h3><br />This book inspired me to start a simple daily journaling habit every morning. Beyond that, I discovered how I could use daily journaling to plot novels, plan blog posts, analyze goals, and more.<br />Thanks to this book, I now have a personal database of journaling prompts taken from various resources that I like, and that I enjoy referring to as needed.<br /><br /><h3><b>Year of the Introvert</b></h3><br />The writer of this book says straight out, "I am an INFP." This is a year's worth of journaling prompts for self-exploration. I picked out my favorites and added them to my personal list of journaling prompts.<br /><br /><h3><b>Running on Empty by Dr. Jonice Webb</b></h3><br />If you're an INFP who is suffering from chronic feelings of being misunderstood, feeling lonely in the crowd, or invisibility--you should read this book. You may have experienced CEN.<br /><br /><h3><b>Emotional First Aid</b></h3><br />If you're an INFP with overwhelming emotions, this book has some great journaling exercises to bring back emotional balance. Whenever I feel left out or like I'm not fitting in with others, I like doing the writing exercise from the chapter on rejection along with the other tips. For me, it always does the trick.<br /><br /><h3><b>How to Be Everything by Emilie Wapnick</b></h3><br />INFPs also use extroverted intuition which means our minds are always coming up with new ideas and connections. It's so easy to get overwhelmed with the ideas and potential projects. This book works to take care of the overwhelm. There are some good suggestions here not only on how to merge together varying interests into one project, but also how to find the time to dabble in ideas and projects that are interesting to you.<br /><br /><h3>Refuse to Choose by Barbara Sher</h3><br />This book is also for those who are overwhelmed with ideas. <i>How to Be Everything</i> and <i>Refuse to Choose</i> are similar, but different. One covers information that the other doesn't, and that amazes me. Between these two books, you will be finding your way to personal project peace.<br /><br />My favorite idea from <i>Refuse to Choose</i> is the Scanner Daybook. I've never written down all of my ideas, until I got myself a Daybook. The act of writing down my ideas and growing them has been so helpful. Not only do I avoid starting on meaningless projects, but it also give me a place to play with my ideas until I'm like, "I'm ready to <b>really</b> do something with this!"<br /><br /><br /><h3>Creativity Takes Courage! by</h3><br />If you're an INFP who is having trouble committing to projects and seeing them through, this book will help get you back on course.With it's insightful journaling exercises and fun paper goodies, you'll find yourself working on your projects a little bit every day, and learning ways to find your groove with projects while not feeling pressured.<br /><br /><h3>Steal Like an Artist and Show Your Work! by Austin Kleon</h3><br />Both of these books are a fantastic kick in the pants. Both encourage enjoying the process of creating over the results, which is nice because it's so easy to get so focused on results that creating becomes more of a chore than fun. I also appreciate <i>Show Your Work</i> because it simplifies the process of sharing your work in a world where social media pressures us to post so often.<br /><br /><br /><h4>Follow the rabbit holes!</h4><br />As you read these books, you may run into other ideas and topics you want to explore. Don't ignore that urge. Follow the tangents that take you off track. You will be amazed by what what you discover.<br /><br />And if I discover any more helpful books, I'll share them here.<br /><br /><div><br /></div>
