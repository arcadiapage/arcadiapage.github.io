Is your planner inspiring? Most people don't think of their calendar as a place to be inspired. It's usually full of duties: events, appointments, and things that can't be ignored. Sometimes it feels like we are constantly cramming things into our calendars and lives.

The general view is that planning is for getting things done, not for daydreaming and reflection.

However, if your planner makes you feel so rushed and overwhelmed that you're dreading to look at it, you need to add some inspiration. Also, if you feel like your planner is a list of soulless tasks, you need to make more room for reflection.

Even if you simply feel unmotivated to plan, although planning is something you want to (and need to) do, adding some space to think can help.

From September to November, I'll be writing on the topic of Thoughtful Planning.

My posts will be all about the importance of paying close attention to the tasks we need to do, how we feel about them, and how they mesh with the reality of our lives. Planning is not just about getting things done. It can also be an extension of taking care of ourselves.

I'll be covering how to be more mindful when planning in general. I'll also share how to be more thoughtful when setting goals and creating the general mood for your day.

Over the past eight months, I've started Bullet Journaling again. Bullet Journaling is a great example of thoughtful planning because it leaves room not only for tasks but also for ideas and reflection.

And since returning to Bullet Journaling, I have created the simplest and most effective Bujo layout I have ever used, and I can't wait to share that with you!

Of course, not all days are perfect, so I'll also be writing about what to do when things don't go as planned.

**So what can you do right now to add some reflection to your planning and build a better day? Here are three short prompts try:**

1\. When did I look and feel my best today?

2\. What challenged me today? What can I do to overcome it?

3\. What is one thing I could do tomorrow to start the day right?

Now, take your answers and copy them to your planner or to-do list. For example, is it possible for you to repeat what made you feel good today tomorrow? If so, add it to your list.

Do you have some ideas on how to overcome a challenge? Pick one of them, and add it to your list.

Do you have an idea of what will give your day a better start? Add that to your list and do that first thing tomorrow.

With these simple prompts, your day is already more meaningful. You now have tasks on your to-do list that matter. It's a combination of productivity and fulfillment.

It's also a way to reduce planning pressure and mix some positivity along with getting stuff done.

Do you know someone is stressing out over their to-do list? Email this article to them! I'm sure they'll appreciate the three journal prompts.
