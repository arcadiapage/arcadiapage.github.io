Today I woke up feeling exhausted. Normally when I get up in the morning, I'm ready to go and returning to bed is not an option. But as I felt my eyes closing as I wrote in my journal, I knew it would be a good idea to get some more sleep. So I did&nbsp;and slept in until 10 AM. For me, that's sleeping in.<br /><br />I stayed up late last night working on giving the template of this blog a refresh. Google has released some new templates for Blogger, and I thought it would be good to switch to one of them, especially since I was having a few issues with the 3rd party template I installed.<br /><br />Optimistically, I'm hoping that this post will mark me returning to my blog. I feel like I'm notoriously&nbsp;bad at sticking to stuff at times. Maybe I just set my expectations too high. But when I left my previous blog, I knew why I wanted to leave it. Yet, when I got here, I found myself staring at the blank page, finding it hard to remember what I wanted anymore.<br /><br />I wanted a blog where I could throw more at it than just comic making advice. I enjoy writing and art. I wanted something that could take both. And figuring out what to write was a pain.<br /><br />From the point of a storyteller--as someone who creates fiction written and drawn, blogging something other than how-to articles seems like a tough but necessary thing to do. It like when you Google blogging advice, the results are more catered to non-fiction. "Pick a few topics and stick to them." "Top ten lists are great."<br /><br />This advice is a good fit for those who have information to share, and a lot of storytellers do take the how-to article angle. It isn't like I'm never going to write anything on this blog about the craft of writing or art techniques, but I feel like doing nothing but how-to posts isn't good for the main audience of someone who makes fiction. And the main audience of a fiction-maker such as myself are people who enjoy what I create. The main thing I do is entertain, and how-to articles may be good for other writers and artists, but not exactly for readers.<br /><br />It's an ongoing struggle for those who make fiction, and in my search&nbsp;for blogging identity, I've found some helpful articles. My favorite is this one&nbsp;at <a href="http://www.writerswrite.com/journal/nov05/the-authors-dilemma-to-blog-or-not-to-blog-11051" target="_blank">The Internet Writing Journal</a>. My second favorite is this one at <a href="http://www.diyauthor.com/16-blog-post-ideas-novelists-will-engage-right-audience/" target="_blank">DIY Author</a>. The second one is the typical, "Things Fiction Writers Should Blog About" kind of post, but it's without a doubt, the best list I've found so far. My number one favorite is a really old post written in 2005, but I think this article hits the heart of what storytellers should blog about, and brought back to mind some of the artist blogs I like to follow.<br /><br />On the artist blogs I follow, I've noticed that the artists tend to write about how their day went or what's going on in their life, and then show a piece of artwork or something in progress. They may write a little bit about their technique, but not much. Still, I find getting a peek into their lives so interesting.<br /><br />Fiction writers are the same. I don't need to think of a blog post about writing or how to write. I write every day. What I need to write about is what I'm doing and share a little bit of that. When I think about it, I feel super excited, because I do all kinds of stuff every day--typical things and things that are related to my story.<br /><br />So will this become a daily blog? We'll see. Will I blog more often now? Most definitely.<br /><br />My husband is cooking dinner as I type this, I think to myself of what a fortunate girl I am! üòç After dinner, I'm going to be working more on the 2nd book of <b>The Altered Realities of a Dream-maker</b>.<br /><br />In case you didn't know, I'm currently posting Book 1 of this story,&nbsp;<b>The Altered Realities of a Dream-maker: Jellyfish Dreams,</b> on <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/story/101342518-the-altered-realities-of-a-dream-maker?utm_source=web&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_content=share_myworks&amp;wp_uname=ArcadiaPage&amp;wp_originator=P85t2oAORBn03hs2bi%2F%2Fc0rDAvgBN3Kw2CRMNfFe2k817vdRnsii6k9LbAk%2BlbK855GwCUKjt%2BSL37%2BIHhunLWZcaWACN6gxei9M5lsdCT8UPcpQsleswZih5a0T8Frc&amp;_branch_match_id=384433700558100067" target="_blank">Wattpad</a>.<br /><br />I'm testing out voice typing. It takes a little bit to get used to, but I like it because it saves my hands from the wear of writing longhand and regular typing. And I still need to come up with a title for the second book.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
