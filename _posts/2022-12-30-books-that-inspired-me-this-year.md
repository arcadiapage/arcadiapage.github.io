# Post Highlights

* Book titles: **The Empowered Empath** by Kriten Schwartz, **Ayurveda Every Day** by Monica Bloom, **Enneagram Empowerment** by Laura Miltenberger.
* Self-care is less effective when you don't know who you are.
* You don't have to come from a super dysfunctional family to have co-dependent tendencies.
