<div style="background-color: white; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: small;"><br /></div><div><span style="background-color: rgba(255 , 255 , 255 , 0.8); font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 16px; white-space: pre-wrap;">When I thought about writing this post, I felt uneasy because I wanted to keep my deeply held thoughts to myself. But sometimes, I think it's good to share what's really going on. I have finished the first part of my story series <i>The Altered Realities of a Dream-Maker</i> and the second, but as I started on the third, I felt anxiety. I like this story, and it feels okay, but I don't love it. On top of that, when I finished the first story completely--polished, edited and everything--I found myself unable to press the publish button because it's shorter than I realized. It's only 16,000 words. Looking at things as a reader, if I bought something to read, I would like to get a bit more.   On top of that, although I enjoy writing, I cannot deny the visual artist in me who likes to draw comics. I feel like both sides have been warring with each other ever since...I finished Mascara and that was like, five years ago. I'm getting to the point where I can't stand the conflict anymore. I'm paralyzed by indecision and constantly switching directions.   So now I'm throwing up my hands like, "Enough of this!" That is, enough of trying to categorize </span><g class="gr_ gr_1730 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" data-gr-id="1730" id="1730" style="animation: gr__appear_critical 0.4s ease forwards; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8); background-image: url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml; background-position: -1px calc(100% + 3px); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size: calc(100% + 1px) 100%; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; http: //www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='100%' height='100%'%3E%3Cline opacity='0.75' x1='4' y1='100%' x2='100%' y2='100%' transform='translate(-1.5, -2.5)' stroke-width='3' stroke-linecap='round' stroke='%23fc5454'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;); white-space: pre-wrap;">myself</g><span style="background-color: rgba(255 , 255 , 255 , 0.8); font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 16px; white-space: pre-wrap;"> into one of two boxes. As a writer, I should be doing such and such. As an artist, I should be doing such and such. But I'm equally drawn to both. Also, realizing that right now I'm more into writing stories of novella and novelette length, I need to be more realistic.   As a result of all these realizations, I think that the best way for me to go is to create collections. I'm going to start creating </span><g class="gr_ gr_32 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling" data-gr-id="32" id="32" style="animation: gr__appear_critical 0.4s ease forwards; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8); background-image: url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml; background-position: -1px calc(100% + 3px); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size: calc(100% + 1px) 100%; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; http: //www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='100%' height='100%'%3E%3Cline opacity='0.75' x1='4' y1='100%' x2='100%' y2='100%' transform='translate(-1.5, -2.5)' stroke-width='3' stroke-linecap='round' stroke='%23fc5454'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;); white-space: pre-wrap;">ebooks</g><span style="background-color: rgba(255 , 255 , 255 , 0.8); font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 16px; white-space: pre-wrap;"> that hold a collection of work, from writing to comics and other stuff that comes out of my mind. At first, I was a bit hesitant about trying this because I've never seen anyone do something like that, but then I feel I have nothing to lose. I have completed work that I have not been able to share, mainly because I have had no clue of how to share it. So why not throw it all together and see what happens? </span></div><div><span style="background-color: rgba(255 , 255 , 255 , 0.8); font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 16px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></div>
