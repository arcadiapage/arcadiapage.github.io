Sometimes it can be hard to find a writing schedule that works, especially when you have a busy life.<br /><br />But the nice thing about writing is that it doesn't take much time to write a few words, and thanks to mobile devices, it's possible to write anywhere at anytime.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gJg3PokHNQE/XXKeAstx_yI/AAAAAAAAEmM/dkB1v-F5JWsn7y91xqZY2w0OgUuCJvNlgCEwYBhgL/s1600/the%2Bperfect%2Bpinterest%2Bpin.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1102" data-original-width="735" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gJg3PokHNQE/XXKeAstx_yI/AAAAAAAAEmM/dkB1v-F5JWsn7y91xqZY2w0OgUuCJvNlgCEwYBhgL/s1600/the%2Bperfect%2Bpinterest%2Bpin.png" /></a></div><br /><span style="text-align: center;"><br /></span><span style="text-align: center;"><br /></span><span style="text-align: center;">Here are two of my favorite writing routines:</span><br /><span style="text-align: center;"><br /></span><br /><h3><span style="text-align: center;">Write for 10 minutes before or after a meal.&nbsp;</span></h3><br />The meal is the anchor. If I do something directly after a meal (or any other regular habit) I'm more likely to do it consistently. And 10 minutes is enough to get something done.<br /><br />When I was working in retail, I managed to finish <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00THFRBRY?*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0" target="_blank">The Blue Room Caf√©</a> by writing 20 minutes every morning after breakfast before I went to work. When I say writing, I also mean the work of creating characters, plot, and setting, and editing. It was the only time I had to write. In the evenings I was too tired.<br /><br />If you want to learn more about successfully creating habits, I recommend checking about my book, <a href="https://books2read.com/u/b5rA1A" target="_blank">Idealist Dreams, How I Learned to Plan as an INFP</a>. Although it is mainly for those of the INFP personality type, I feel that much of the information in it is helpful for anyone who struggles with planning and routine.<br /><br /><h3>Write like you're taking medicine:</h3><br />This is my current schedule, and I love it. As a result, I write almost an hour everyday without much effort. This idea comes from <b>A Writer's Space</b> by Eric Maisel.<br /><br />Following this method, I set my writing times to 8AM, 12PM, 4PM, and 8PM. I have a daily alarm set for each time. When the alarm goes off, I write for 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the circumstances.<br /><br />It's amazing how I can easily write at these times on a daily basis, even on days when I work.<br /><br /><h3>Setting up your routine:</h3><br />How long do you think you can write everyday? Can you write 10 or 15 minutes? Even five minutes is okay. It's better to get a few words on the page than nothing.<br /><br /><h3>Use this <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iG3D_hMQh7ZZUxjh3dR83_sp9R1o6o0Q" target="_blank">simple worksheet</a> to plan a basic schedule anchored to your daily tasks or a timed routine.&nbsp;</h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZK8xMNKdSFc/XXKjiTSgf_I/AAAAAAAAEmU/RJPu607JSLEqR-VognUUoQ3xLeORoYnzgCLcBGAs/s1600/Annotation%2B2019-09-06%2B141721.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="723" data-original-width="974" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZK8xMNKdSFc/XXKjiTSgf_I/AAAAAAAAEmU/RJPu607JSLEqR-VognUUoQ3xLeORoYnzgCLcBGAs/s1600/Annotation%2B2019-09-06%2B141721.png" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div><br /></div><br />Try your schedule for a week and see if it works. If it doesn't, take a step back and ask yourself why it's not working. What's holding you back from writing like you planned? What could make your routine work better? And then, try again.<br /><br />Have a curious attitude. You're a writing scientist.<br /><br />Eventually from patient trial and error, you will find a method that works consistently for you.<br /><br /><b>Do you already have a regular writing schedule?
