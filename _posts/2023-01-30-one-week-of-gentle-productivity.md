Right now, I'm working on a book entitled "100 Days of Gentle Productivity."  I chose 100 days because I'm creating this book with [Kickstarter's Make100 challenge](http://kck.st/3XRvREA) in mind.

But...it doesn't have to take 100 days to feel the benefits of approaching each day with more care. So here I'm sharing the first seven prompts from my book so you can create a week of gently getting things done. I suggest having a notebook or a place where you can write your thoughts as you go through these.

You can approach these prompts in order, out of order, or by what resonates with you. Do whatever makes you feel the most comfortable.

# Day One

We all have things that we enjoy doing to slow down and relax.

_How would you like to slow down today when you get a moment?_

Remember that relaxing doesn't have to take a lot of time. Just five minutes is enough.

# Day Two

Today, take a moment to consider where in your life you are pushing to get things done.

And by pushing, I'm not referring to simply working hard to accomplish something. I'm talking about straining to make things happen, so much so that it may even feel like you're hitting a wall.

* Where are you striving to get things done?
* Where are you pushing?
* What changes can you make so that you can strive a little less?
* Is striving even necessary for that part of your life?

# Day Three

Often it's the little things that can keep us going throughout the day. Take some time out to put on some relaxing music and enjoy some tea or a smoothie while working on a task.

# Day Four

Time to get honest.

Take a moment to note what is hard for you today and how you feel about it. It's okay if you don't have solutions. Often awareness alone is enough to make dealing with challenges easier.

If you have a habit of downplaying what is difficult for you, you may not be able to tell if you're overreaching, and you may miss out on giving yourself a break when you need it the most.

# Day Five

Let's release all of the tasks, to-do's, and other mental chatter that's rattling around in your head by doing a brain dump.

Set a timer for five to ten minutes and on a piece of paper, let out everything that's on your mind.

Don't worry about being neat or making sense. Just release what's there. After the time is up, look at what you wrote.

_Highlight the items that must be handled today and that are the most important to you._

# Day Six

Do a brain dump for five or ten minutes.

But this time pay attention to how you feel afterward.

* Do you feel more relaxed?
* Or do you feel the same?

Consider if letting your thoughts out regularly can help you to manage feeling overwhelmed.

# Day Seven

At some point today, take a five-minute break to simply close your eyes.

Don't worry about controlling your breathing or thinking about stuff. All of that is fine. Simply close your eyes and give them a rest for five minutes. Notice how you feel after time's up.
