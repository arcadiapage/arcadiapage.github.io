Welcome to the first edition of Four Links! This concept was inspired by the blog of technology writer [Scott Nesbitt](https://scottnesbitt.net/). When I first came across his four links posts, I fell in love with them. Whenever I visit his blog, [The Plain Text Project](https://plaintextproject.online/index.html), his four-link posts are the first things I look at because they give me the thrill of discovery. And I'm looking forward to sharing that same excitement with you.

Until August, I'm writing on the topic of "The INFP Entrepreneur." So the theme of these four links is "Business Basics & Inspiration."  The information on these sites has helped me to focus on creating books that are helpful and to build a work ethic that keeps me productive in a mindful way. Take note of any points that hit home with you in these posts, and hopefully, they'll get you started on your business-building project.
