<br />Here's the basic rundown of how my personal writing challenge has been going so far:<br /><br /><b>Day One:</b><br /><br />I am enthusiastic and ready to go. I eat dark chocolate to keep myself alert and lemon water to keep hydrated. To overcome my tendency to over-edit while typing, I try to keep usage of the backspace button to a minimum. Instead, I move my cursor to where I made the mistake and continue typing without erasing what I did before. I've found that this is a better medium between being in the moment and editing. &nbsp;After all the typing my hands felt a little crampy. Made plans to use Swype instead next time.<br /><br />Time: 2 hours 30 min<br />Words: 2,000<br /><br /><b>Day Two:</b><br /><br />When I come out of my room my husband says to me, "You're really playing up the disheveled writer look."<br /><br />"I'm not trying to," I say, afraid of how naturally the stereotype&nbsp;came to me. I wore a relaxed, button up blouse, a just above knee length, casual skirt, and my hair was loose and frizzy. And the fact that I wear glasses didn't help. Guess I just need to own up to the fact that I am a disheveled writer right now.<br /><br />I used Swype, and just as I thought, it's slower. However, I have less of an urge to correct myself. I decided to go back to typing on Day 3.<br /><br />Time: 2 hours 50 minutes<br />Words: 2,069<br /><br /><b>Day Three:</b><br />Since I didn't like the idea of having hand cramps from typing, I introduced the Pomodoro&nbsp;method to my writing time. I've used it for other things and didn't really care for it, but for writing, it is killer. I ate more chocolate and used my Pomodoro&nbsp;breaks to exercise. Not bad. I take the leap and turn off spellcheck.<br /><br />Time: 1 hour 40 minutes<br />Words: 2,000<br /><br /><b>Day Four:</b><br /><br />I listen to A9 on repeat as I write. I think about buying more Japanese and Korean music because I love the songs, and I'm not distracted by the lyrics. I'm typing and now have added coffee to the mix. I blame my fast typing on the cat-eared&nbsp;hat that I wear while I'm writing.<br /><br />Time: 1 hour 40 minutes<br />Words: 2,500<br /><br /><b>Day Five:</b><br /><br />After day four I was feeling totally tired, so I decided to dial back the amount of time that I was writing. Still typing on my computer and using Pomodoro&nbsp;breaks to workout. I swore that next time I'm going to make my own iced coffee because I can make better ice coffee than what comes in those cartons from the store. I am amazed by how plot twists are coming to me naturally. I do have an outline, but sometimes things happen in a story that are unplanned by the writer that adds some spice and surprise. That's happening to me more often now, and I'm thrilled.<br /><br />Time: 1 hour 20 minutes<br />Words: 2,080<br /><br /><b>Notes:</b> &nbsp;While doing this my husband often asks me if it's tiring. It is sort of, although it takes not much more time than watching a movie. I think the hardest thing is that when I know it's the start of a new session my mind is like, "There is no way you can write that much!" But when I sit down and start typing, I do it. Every single time. So the hardest part is struggling against that mental wall when I sit in the chair. But once I get going, I cannot believe how naturally the words are coming to me.
