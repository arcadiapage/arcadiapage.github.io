If you've been following my work for awhile, you may have heard me mention that I've been suffering from some major fiction writing and artists’ block. 

In fact, in my post [Being a Productive Human is Simple. Working Like a Machine is Complicated,](https://arcadiapage.com/2023-12-31-being-a-productive-human-is-simple/) I do some serious whining about it. But this week, I posted the first part of a Miraculous fanfic short story to [Tumblr,](https://www.tumblr.com/arcadiasfiction/746021432397611008/cat-text-part-one?source=share) and at that moment I knew deep down that it's time I came back home.

I've been dealing with a dry spell of finding fiction stories to write for about eight years. As for drawing comic style art, it's been almost ten years.

But the dry spell is officially over. Not only do I have multiple works of fanfiction to share, but I also have my own original fiction ideas waiting for me to give them attention. And I'm more than ready to do so.

On top of that, my stories are demanding illustrations from me, so there's the undeniable feeling of coming around full circle. I feel like I'm retrieving a piece of my soul that I was having a hard time finding.

On some levels, I wish the dry spell never happened, but it's almost like I had a lesson to learn. [My webcomic from back in the day](https://ia801806.us.archive.org/33/items/smackjeeves-59912/59912/index.html#1) was all about a boy who was having a hard time embracing what he loved doing and who he loved being. And once I learned about my personal shadows, I realized that [I have been suffering from the same problem on a deep level](https://arcadiapage.com/2022-09-30-what-it-s-like-being-an-infp-enneagram-type-3/). I kept [living a life that didn't fit me.](https://arcadiapage.com/2024-03-24-enneagram-type-3-how-to-be-yourself/) For me the key to everything is simply doing what I love.

On the other hand, if the block had never happened, I wouldn’t have had the joy of bringing [seven nonfiction](https://payhip.com/ArcadiaPage/collection/books) books into the world. I know that there will be more.

I have no idea where this creative shift is going to take me, but I know that inside, taking this direction makes me feel more creatively whole. However, I've found that no matter what I create, from blog posts to nonfiction to straight up fiction my main creative mission remains the same:

*What I create is all about living in harmony with one's true nature, abilities and energy.*

That currently shows no signs of changing, and I believe that finding inner harmony leads to outer harmony, and vice versa. 

So since that's the case, I'm going to keep going with this blog and other creative projects to help others do just that, regardless of if it's fiction or nonfiction, journals, courses or whatever else I feel like creating or doing.

Moving back into fiction is going to change how I write for this blog a little. This change has been happening for a while, but I won't be writing as often about specific personality types, unless it's something that I'm dying to share.

But I will be writing more about:

- The creative process—especially as a writer
- Doing business as a multipassionate creative
- And staying motivated, organized (kinda) and burnout free through the whole process. 

I also want to write about how my sensitivity and intuition plays a role in how I create and work.

I almost want to say that my blog is shifting to being more personal, but it's kind of that already. It'll be more about my work, the motivational forces behind that, and what I'm learning from it all. 

I think that's another lesson I needed to learn: how to not let my creative ambitions overshadow taking care of myself. I feel this is something that everyone needs to learn in an environment where it's so easy to turn your creativity into a job. Creative work is different, and you need to leave room for life if you want to stay inspired. 

I sense that this blog is going to become a more mature version of [the blog I had before](https://manga-arcadia.blogspot.com/), although I am still a crazy goofy awkward fangirl at the end of the day. Maturity is relative. 

If you're interested in reading my Miraculous short story fanfic entitled Chat Text, you can do so [here on Tumblr.](https://www.tumblr.com/arcadiasfiction/746021432397611008/cat-text-part-one?source=share) 

With nonfiction, my genres are obvious: productivity and personal growth.

However as a fiction writer, I really love creating slice-of-life and romance. I also like stories that could be romantic, but are not. If I can give it an otherworldly vibe—that’s even better. Touches of sci-fi or fantasy are nice. I especially enjoy creating witty dialogue and sticky/potentially embarrassing situations for my main characters. 

When it comes to fiction, I always tell myself to not be a cowardly writer who goes for what's easy. If my beloved children are on the road to hardship and chaos, then let them live it and learn from it, even if it makes my writing process more challenging. Stories are much more exciting that way. 

And I also want you to know that although I've outlined this shift in my creative intentions, this isn't just about me. 

I especially would like to know, are there any topics you wish I would write about? Do you have any questions about how I work as a writer or stay prolifically creative while going with the flow of my sensitivity, intuition, and scatteredness? 

Share your thoughts by clicking the reply link below—I really want to make the rest of this year about how although being a working sensitive creative can be challenging, confusing, and heartbreaking at times, it also can be a fun, inspiring, and an unexpected vehicle for personal growth.
