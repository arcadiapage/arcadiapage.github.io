They had that tangy scent of old paper.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">The first page was the typical "If this journal is lost" verbiage. Underneath that was the looping and neat scrawl of someone who had taken their cursive seriously. -- Mandy in <b>Summer Nightmares</b></blockquote><br />I created my first journal when I was six. It was a handmade book I designed out of a cereal box for the cover, paper bags for the pages inside, and then bound together with a shoelace string. I would write one or two sentences about what happened that day, and then draw a picture of it.<br /><br />I didn't start journaling regularly until I was ten, and I still do it today.<br /><br />Why do I journal? First of all, it has been a main force in restoring my emotional health many times in my life. I can air out my thoughts and figure out the solutions to my problems when I write them. Also, journaling is great writing practice, keeping my writer's voice true. Below are some journaling ideas and methods that I like and have found helpful.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><strong>Morning pages.</strong> For me, Morning Pages are the most powerful method of journaling. It's like a total brain detox. I do it at least once a week, and I feel driven to do it when my thoughts are flowing from my brain like an over-running bathtub. Whenever I do morning pages, I find myself falling into drowsiness as I write. This happens even if I do it in the middle of the day, because writing my thoughts as they come and observing them is the most relaxing thing ever.  <br /><br />Another benefit of morning pages is that it helped me out big-time with developing my writing voice. I learned how to write the way I think. Want to learn more about the power of morning pages?

Download my morning pages printables from <b><a href="https://landing.mailerlite.com/webforms/landing/r1r3p7">The Collection</a></b> and get started.

Sometimes when I'm having a problem, I write about it and then compare it to a time in the past when I've faced something similar. And it doesn't have to be similar circumstances--it could even be a moment that evoked similar emotions. When I compare present problem with past difficulties, light is cast on what I can do now, and I no longer feel trapped.<br /><br /><strong>Lists.</strong> If doing morning pages is a bit too much, try keeping a list journal. List journals are nice because they're like a catalog. Make lists of what TV shows you're watching, what books your reading, beautiful things you saw today, scary things you saw today‚Ä¶You can make a list of just about anything. I think list journaling is also attractive because it's a very focused way of letting your thoughts free. A gratitude journal is a well known type of list journaling.<br /><br /><strong>Write Your Breakfast.</strong> This is a fun journaling exercise that I've doing for a few weeks based on the book <strong>Art Before Breakfast</strong> by Danny Gregory. In the book there is this art exercise where you sketch your breakfast every day for a month. The point of it is for you to learn that there is art everywhere, even in the little things, and how creating art doesn't have to be a huge undertaking all the time. Gregory calls it ‚Äúart with a little a.‚Äù So as a twist on that, I've been writing descriptions of my breakfast every day for a few weeks.<br /><br /><em>Sept 12th</em><br />The bowl of oatmeal sat before her on the oaken table, the bowl round like a porcelain wheel filled with a lumpy brown lake dotted with raisins.<br /><br />I eat a lot of oatmeal, and sometimes I see myself in the third person, lol. It's amazing though how even the tiniest details of daily life can sound like part of a story. The point is, a journal can keep you constantly creative, even if you only have five or ten minutes to spare.<br /><br /><strong>Writer's Notebook.</strong> A collection of&nbsp; writing advice, things you like, books you like, quotes, and so on. This is a notebook of all the things you need as a writer. Right now my writer's journal has lists of things that I like in stories and things I don't.<br /><br />For more about making a Writer's Notebook, check out this post at <a href="https://letterpile.com/writing/Inspiration-Journal">Letter Pile</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Common Placing.</strong> This is closely related to having a writer's notebook, except that it places more importance of copying quotes and information out of books and writing down interesting things that you hear and observe. <br /><br />I can't describe common placing any better than this excellent post at <a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/08/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/">The Thought Catalog</a>. After you read it, you will be driven to create your own handwritten library of found knowledge. <br /><br />I tried doing the index card thing, but now the Bullet Journal I carry in my Traveler's Notebook is my common place book. I like writing beautiful passages from novels in it. <br /><br /><strong>Bringing it All Together</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong>These are a lot of different journals, and it may not be ideal to have a separate book for each one of these. I've found Bullet Journaling a great way to bring a variety of different types of journaling under one book, and to be able to find my entries when I'm looking back.<br /><br /><strong>Apps</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong>My current favorite journaling apps are <strong>Write A Day</strong> and <strong>Day Gram</strong>. They are text only and minimalist. The rainbow interface of <strong>Write A Day</strong> makes journaling addictive. I write in it everyday. <br /><br />If you don't journal right now, it's never too late to get started. It's easy. It improves your writing skills, and it protects your mental health. It's good all-around!<br /><br />To get started, here is my current morning pages printable is now available in <b>The Collection</b>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZyC8YrGZfB0/We-ETI-00hI/AAAAAAAAD90/PordkrWI-QwuJWmmo2772ocOEHlpiyivQCLcBGAs/s1600/Download%2Byour%2Bfree%2B%25281%2529.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="315" data-original-width="560" height="360" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZyC8YrGZfB0/We-ETI-00hI/AAAAAAAAD90/PordkrWI-QwuJWmmo2772ocOEHlpiyivQCLcBGAs/s640/Download%2Byour%2Bfree%2B%25281%2529.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;">If you don't already have access to <b>The Collection</b>, <a href="https://landing.mailerlite.com/webforms/landing/r1r3p7">click here to get in.</a>&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">So questions?
