It's too bad that people tend to snub the best overlooked resources. Diamonds in the rough. Right now my husband and I don't have much money, so I've been dividing our shopping between Target and the Dollar Tree. At Target I can find vegetables, fruits, etc... for around a dollar or less for each item. At the Dollar Tree, most items are $1.25, so that has been a great resource for getting basic household items and pantry supplies.

I've always had a knack for finding good stuff in the midst of what a lot of people would just ignore or assume is just a bunch of crap. I think it's so cool how I can buy whole milk for like a dollar at the Dollar Tree and use that to enjoy my gluten free breakfast cereal from Amazon which I load up with sliced banana and apple that I picked up at Target. There is so much certified gluten free stuff at the Dollar Tree, but people don't typically think of looking there for those kinds of items. And although the food amounts are smaller than what's at the typical grocery store, in general it's true that people in "developed" countries waste so much food. Food waste is so common it makes me think that maybe, especially in the US where I live, maybe...we should be buying less anyways?

My favorite thing about making the most of what I have is how it makes me feel. On one end, it makes me frustrated because I'm always trying to solve problems and manage the flow of resources all the time. But on the flip side, when I find a good solution to an issue, I feel like I can handle anything. So what if I don't have any money this week? There is a way to make what I already have work and things have a way of working themselves out anyways. 

Lately, I've been thinking deeply about how I can create a minimalist lifestyle that I can stick with for the long term. Maybe minimalist isn't quite the right word for it. And I don't care for the word frugal either, although what I'm aiming for is that. The best word for what I want is economical. I want to build a lifestyle that is permanently economical that fits my needs and the way I function in the world.

As I was bouncing ideas around in my head to figure out what this lifestyle could look like, I couldn't help hitting up ChatGPT to add some scope to my brainstorming. I thought about the aesthetics I enjoy, what I love doing, and what I actually need to feel fulfilled. In the end, I came up with something that's cozy, streamlined, and eclectic.

Here are some elements of my ideal minimalist lifestyle, going from physical aesthetics to lifestyle pillars, courtesy of ChatGPT. And this has been a great way to see that I can have very little money and still create a life that makes me fulfilled.

*Core Elements:*

*Wabi-sabi elegance ‚Äì Simple, natural, imperfect beauty (think Midori notebooks, hand-thrown pottery, linen textures).*

*Coffee shop coziness ‚Äì Wooden accents, warm lighting, soft background music, a space designed for reading and writing.*

*Streamlined but personal ‚Äì Mostly monochrome or neutral tones, with selective pops of color that feel intentional.*

*Asian-inspired minimalism ‚Äì Clean lines, curated decor, elements of Japanese design (furoshiki cloths, ceramics, simple artwork).*

*DIY personal touches ‚Äì Handmade items, thrift flips, upcycled elements that give character without clutter.*

**Since I'm high sensation seeking, having a typical minimalist lifestyle won't have enough variety for me. I need things to be eclectic. Which is also why I call my ideal lifestyle economical--not exactly minimalist.**

Since novelty fuels you, your minimalism must be flexible and refreshing, not rigid and boring.

How to build novelty into your life naturally:

üîÑ Rotation System: Have a set number of items in each category (clothes, art supplies, books) and swap things in and out seasonally. This lets you enjoy variety without owning too much at once.

üé® Creative Challenges: Set monthly creative themes (e.g., only using a limited color palette for a month, writing with a specific mood, styling outfits differently).

üìö Library & Digital Rotations: Keep books, manga, and courses in rotation through libraries, free trials, and digital borrowing.

üì∑ Instant Photography & Journaling: Since you love instant photography, create a minimalist way to display & rotate your photos‚Äîlike a string light display or a rotating gallery wall.

**And of course, having a vision for spending and lifestyle is essential:**

Spending Priorities:

‚úî Essential Stability First: Rent, utilities, AIP-friendly food, self-care essentials.

‚úî Micro-Luxury Budget: A tiny budget ($5-$15/month) for one joyful, high-impact purchase (a thrifted book, a special tea, a small art supply).

‚úî Experience-Based Indulgence: Instead of physical purchases, focus on rituals and experiences that feel luxurious (cozy at-home caf√© setups, spa nights, beautifully plated meals

Daily Living That Feels Like an Art Form üé≠‚ú®

Minimalism should feel like a beautifully composed life rather than a set of restrictions.

üé∂ Soundtrack Your Life: Soft jazz, lo-fi beats, or instrumental music that makes every moment feel intentional.

üìñ A Reading/Writing Ritual: A daily or weekly habit of reading/writing in your cozy caf√© space with a drink in hand.

üçµ Tea & Coffee Rituals: Treat your tea/coffee time as a mindful ritual, savoring the experience instead of rushing through it.

üçΩÔ∏è Beautiful Daily Eating: Even simple meals can feel indulgent if presented thoughtfully‚Äîsmall plates, candles, chopsticks, Japanese-style bowls.

üíñ Scent & Atmosphere: Candles, incense, or natural room sprays that make your home feel like a sanctuary.

‚ú® Goal: Every day feels like a small act of artistry, turning simple moments into rich experiences.

... Basically, although my lifestyle isn't really a choice because I've been forced into it due to economic pressures, **I want it to feel like a choice.** I want to transform not being able to afford much into an opportunity to create what really matters. 

I care about art, beauty, creativity, and words, and I don't have to spend another dollar to bring those things into my life. They're already here.
