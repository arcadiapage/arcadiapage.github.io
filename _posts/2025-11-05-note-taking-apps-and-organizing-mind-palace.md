The library of the mansion was beautifully designed with classic elegance. I admired the glossy wood paneling on the walls and the sturdy shelving made of heavier, more robust wood, highly polished and stained dark.

Apparently, [I have a thing for shelves](https://arcadiapage.com/2025-10-14-recollecting-the-lost-pieces-of-myself/). I carefully organized the books on them while [wearing black leather driving gloves](https://arcadiapage.com/2025-10-14-recollecting-the-lost-pieces-of-myself/). I could feel within myself the need to have things a certain way because this library was mine. Each adjustment made it more aligned with my intentions.

While I was working, a young man approached me. When I saw him, I immediately recognized him because [I had stolen his body in the past](https://arcadiapage.com/2025-05-29-that-time-I-stole-some-guys-body/). He has handsome dark hair and dark eyes, and today he wore black dress clothes. He said to me with a soft and charming smile, "You need to let people see this side of yourself more often.”

This part of me is so [Enneagram 3](https://arcadiapage.com/2022-09-30-what-it-s-like-being-an-infp-enneagram-type-3/). Oh. My shadow.

After waking, I wasn't sure which side of me he meant. Maybe he meant the side of me that lovingly tends to the garden of writing and books. Maybe he also was alluding to all of the subconscious material I've accumulated, and how I go about documenting and organizing it. But then it could also just be the part of me that loves learning with reverence and devotion, and who collects and meticulously organizes the best stuff in a sprawling private library of notes and notebooks.

It's probably all of those things and more. I also kind of sense that the side of me that's compassionate but a bit controlling is involved too. In any case, [the one hidden among the bookshelves is also me.](https://arcadiapage.com/2025-09-28-omnigirl-eight/) 

So with that in mind, I've finally posted two new episodes to my [Random Musings on Creative Tech Podcast](https://arcadiapage.substack.com/podcast) that are all about my top two favorite note-taking apps.

[My Favorite Note-taking App A-Side: Workflowy](https://arcadiapage.substack.com/p/my-favorite-note-taking-app-a-side)

[My Favorite Note-taking Apps B Side: Tiddlywiki](https://arcadiapage.substack.com/p/my-favorite-note-taking-apps-b-side)

If I'm going to share the contours and workings of my mind palace (or maybe I should call it a *mind mansion*?), my favorite note-taking apps are definitely the easiest place to start. 

I'm happy to finally start sharing a little bit more of this side of myself with you. And if you wish to go a bit deeper into this kind of mental organizing, there's also more in my books, specifically, [Thoughtful Planning: How to Use Questions for Self-reflection to Design Your Day](https://payhip.com/b/YSucT) and [I Want to Do All the Things: Finding Balance as a Polymath, Multipotentialite & Renaissance Soul](https://payhip.com/b/4ljG).
