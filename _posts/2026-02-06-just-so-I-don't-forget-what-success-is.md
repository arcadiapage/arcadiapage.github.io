Dear Arcadia, 

I know that sometimes, it’s easy to forget what success is for you, because everyone is always [telling you what your definition of success should be](https://arcadiapage.com/2025-04-14-how-I-learned-that-the-standard-definition-of-success-is-not-for-me/). So I’m here to [remind](https://arcadiapage.com/2025-04-16-You-Are-My-Inspiration/) you of what true success is.

For you, success is this:

It’s seeing the sun peak from under the curtains in the morning. 

Feeling your bare feet on the cool tiles.

Stretching your arms.

Enjoying a cup of tea with breakfast.

Giving your husband a kiss.

Looking into your own eyes in the mirror.

Sitting on the porch.

Reading another book.

Sharing another blog post.

Bringing another creation into the world.

Throwing out what’s not needed.

[Keeping](https://arcadiapage.substack.com/p/withstanding-the-void) what is.

Watching a movie.

Dancing to a song.

Having a healthy meal.

Savoring a shower.

Running your hands through your curls.

Telling others you love them.

Laying in bed to rest…

And finding it. 

Success is in every sweet breath you take. 

That breath in. 

Filling your lungs. 

That’s success. 

I’m not sure if the world is ready for this level of success. But that’s okay.

Because you are.

Success my dear, is not something you find. It’s something that's there for you in every moment.
