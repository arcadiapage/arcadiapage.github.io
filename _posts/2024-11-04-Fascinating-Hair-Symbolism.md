*Him being in such a dark color pallet was already a departure from his usual public image, but the most unexpected thing of all was his hair.*

*Marinette wanted to be more nonchalant about this. Like, it was just his hair—He could cut it, dye it or whatever—it's really not that big of a deal.*

*But for some inexplicable reason, his long silky blond hair was a big deal. And when he lifted a gloved hand to demurely tuck it behind on one of his ears, there were audible screams from onlookers.*

So I’m currently writing a fanfic, and out of all the crazy stuff I’ve written so far, I feel like this move was the most controversial. That’s because when you change a character’s hair, it drastically alters how they are perceived, and I’m actually a little embarrassed by how much I write about hair in this story.

# Hair Symbolism 

Hair in general represents the way we present ourselves to the world. It’s how others see us, and how we want to be seen. I think it’s fascinating how in stories, major changes in a character’s hair can carry a lot of meaning. I love digging into stuff like this, especially how it presents itself in my own creative work. 

With the help of ChatGPT, it’s easier than even to analyze the subconscious symbolism that appears in creative projects. 

*Me to ChatGPT:*

I just realized that I'm working on a piece of fiction right now where hair is a big deal. 

The main male character in the story has just experienced a life altering event and I subconsciously gave him really long hair, not realizing the underlying symbolism. **What could going from short hair to suddenly having long and kind of unruly hair symbolize?**

*ChatGPT:* 

In fiction, hair can carry deep symbolic weight, often reflecting the inner state of a character. Going from short to long, unruly hair after a life-altering event could symbolize:

1. **Loss of Control or Unpredictability:** Unruly hair can represent chaos, a sense of being overwhelmed, or life feeling out of control. After a major event, this could reflect the character’s inner turmoil or his struggle to come to terms with changes in his life.

2. **Personal Freedom or Release:** Long, unkempt hair is often associated with freedom, rebellion, or breaking away from societal norms. It might symbolize the character’s move away from previous constraints or a newfound independence, even if it feels overwhelming at first.

3. **Growth and Transformation:** Long hair can be seen as a metaphor for personal growth or time passing. If the character’s hair has grown rapidly or suddenly, it might symbolize the accelerated change or the intensity of the transformation he's experiencing.

4. **Connection to Nature or Instincts:** Unruly, natural hair often represents a return to one's raw, instinctual self. The character may be reconnecting with his primal nature, his emotions, or parts of himself that he’s previously kept hidden or repressed.

5. **A Shift in Identity:** The change from short to long hair could signal a shift in the character’s self-perception or how others perceive him. Hair is a significant part of how we present ourselves, so this transformation might symbolize an evolving sense of identity.

All of these themes are reflected in my story, but the one theme that really stands out to me is the idea that longer hair can indicate a return to one’s raw, instinctual self. My fanfic is all about that.

**And the implications of going from long to short hair can be just as dramatic…**


*Me to ChatGPT:*

The male character has a superhero identity. In the story, after experiencing a life altering event, his superhero identity goes from having long hair that's kept in a neat ponytail to short hair that's a little unruly. Any thoughts on this symbolism?

(Another unfinished sketch from my sketchbook. But I really want to finish this one! If I had all the correct details and coloring, this could be quite striking.) 

*ChatGPT:*

The change in your character's superhero identity—from long hair in a neat ponytail to short, unruly hair—can symbolize several layers of transformation, especially in the context of a life-altering event. Here are some possible interpretations:

1. **Breaking Away from Control or Discipline:**
   - The neat ponytail might represent control, discipline, and structure—qualities often associated with a more traditional or restrained superhero identity. Cutting it off and embracing shorter, more unruly hair can symbolize breaking free from strict rules or expectations, allowing more spontaneity and freedom in how he operates.
   - It could also reflect a shift from a polished, controlled public image to a more raw, authentic version of himself.

2. **Shedding the Past or Old Persona:**
   - The act of cutting long hair can represent a dramatic severing of the past. The shorter, messier hair could symbolize the shedding of an old persona or identity. Perhaps the life-altering event forces him to evolve, and the haircut symbolizes a fresh start, a new phase in his superhero journey.

3. **Less Concern with Image, More Focus on Action:**
   - A neat ponytail could suggest a character who is concerned with presenting himself in a certain way, possibly maintaining a calculated or refined public image. In contrast, the shorter, unruly hair might reflect a character who’s now less focused on appearances and more on action, efficiency, or survival. It signals a shift toward being more in the moment, ready for whatever challenges come his way.

4. **Loss of Control Over Chaos:**
   - While his long, neatly kept hair symbolizes order and control, the shorter, unruly hair could indicate that after the life-altering event, he’s less in control or is navigating new chaos. His superhero identity might be undergoing a rough period where he's dealing with unpredictability and instability, both internally and externally.

5. **A More Humanized, Relatable Hero:**
   - The neat ponytail might suggest a character who is more detached, perhaps holding himself to an idealized or aloof standard. Transitioning to shorter, slightly unruly hair can signify that he’s become more human, more relatable, and less concerned with maintaining perfection. This could make him more approachable, both to himself and to others, as he embraces imperfection.

6. **Embracing Inner Conflict or Complexity:**
   - The shift from neat and controlled to unruly could symbolize internal conflict or complexity. His superhero persona might now reflect a deeper struggle or duality, as he’s no longer as polished on the outside because of unresolved turmoil within. The unruly hair could be a visual representation of the messy, layered aspects of his identity coming to the surface.

This contrast between his former, more polished self and his current, more chaotic appearance could speak volumes about how deeply the life-altering event has affected his character on a psychological and emotional level. 

Once again, the AI is dead on in its analysis. Although the changes the main character experiences reflects all of these themes, the theme of perfectionism really stands out to me. He lets go of perfectionism to bring in something raw and new.

# Using Hair to Communicate Emotional Fears

I’m currently creating a print version of the webcomic I created ten years ago (because people keep asking me about this project for some reason!), and hair plays a major role in that story too. The main male character doesn’t like how he looks, so he’s often hiding behind a luxurious amount of emo hair as an emotional shield.

But in a scene where he’s finally feeling secure with himself, I draw a rare panel of him with both of his eyes.

Even with the main female character, her hair goes from being in tight braids at the beginning to being in loose waves at the end, symbolizing her transition to a more open and gracious point of view.

# Change Your Hair, Change Your Life

The weirdest thing about being human is that our brains depend on story. Our minds are always trying to create stories out of things. That’s how we make sense of the world. So as a result, this kind of symbolism doesn’t only apply to fiction and literature, but it can cross over into our nocturnal dreams as well. 

Of course, we all come with our own personal set of visual language, so the symbolism we encounter in our dreams can be highly subjective and personal. However, understanding the more universal meanings of symbolism can help with understanding what’s going on in our emotional lives. 

*Me to ChatGPT:*

This morning I dreamed that I had long black wavy hair. In real life my hair is curly but very short. Are there any insights I can take away from the symbolism of this dream?

*ChatGPT:*

Dreaming of long black wavy hair can symbolize personal growth, transformation, or a desire for change. 

Hair often represents strength, identity, and beauty, so seeing your hair long and wavy might indicate a wish to embrace a different part of yourself or step into a new version of your identity. Since your real-life hair is currently very short and curly, the dream could reflect a subconscious longing for more freedom, fluidity, or control in some area of life, or perhaps it's encouraging you to explore new creative or emotional possibilities.

It could also relate to your journey with self-image and how you present yourself to the world, potentially suggesting that you're feeling a shift in how you see yourself or how you want others to perceive you. Have you been thinking about making changes or stepping into a new role or expression lately?

*Me:*

Yes! In my business I'm shifting into presenting myself as an intuitive writer and artist. Before I've mainly positioned myself as a productivity and mindful living writer.

*ChatGPT:*

That shift in your business could definitely be reflected in the dream. The long, wavy hair might symbolize the intuitive, creative flow you're stepping into, embracing a more fluid and expressive side of yourself. 

It could also represent the confidence and ease that comes with aligning more closely with your true identity. As you move into this new phase, the dream may be affirming that this change is natural and part of your personal growth, inviting you to fully embrace your intuitive, artistic self.

# My Own Journey With Identity

So as I write characters who are shedding previous identities, I’m in the process of shedding my own identity as well. 

Over the years, I’ve found maintaining tight control over my online identity and persona, a.k.a “Brand”, very challenging. A long time ago, I was the webcomic girl. Then I became the INFP productivity girl. Then I became more about general productivity and mindful living. All of those things are parts of me, but now I'm shedding all of those strict identities.

My rawest self is an intuitive writer and artist. While working from that space, I am productive and mindful, and I use what I know about myself to my advantage. But at the end of day, I'm still an intuitive creative. I'll never be able to fit myself into the well-polished box of the typical online business owner.

However I do appreciate how the parts of myself that I decide to let go of are never truly gone. Those things still shape and influence who I am growing into. 

So how has your hair or your relationship with hair impacted the way that you see yourself?
