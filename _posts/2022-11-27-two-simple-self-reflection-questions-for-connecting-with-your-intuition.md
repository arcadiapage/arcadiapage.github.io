# Post Highlights

* Have you ever felt deep down that something was not the best idea, but ignored that feeling anyways? Or have you ever felt that something would be really good for you but totally ignored it?
* How would your life change if you paid attention to those signals instead of ignoring them?
* As I've been making my snail-like recovery from chronic pain, listening to my inner signals has played a major role in my healing.
* So today, when you get the twinge that something is a good idea, try it and see what happens. And when you get the feeling that you shouldn't be doing something, or that something isn't the best for you, see what results you get when you try avoiding it.
