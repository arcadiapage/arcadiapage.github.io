If I mess up or if what I'm trying doesn't work, I don't feel like I've wasted a ton of time.&nbsp;</li><li>It's <b>less intimidating</b> because there is less space to fill.</li><li><b>Easy to share</b>. I confess it's been awhile since I've used Instagram. Social media has always been touch and go for me, but if I wanted to regularly share a piece of art or writing, creating small makes it easier.</li></ul>Overall, creating small allows me to get more satisfaction with how I use my limited creative time. Lately, I've been focusing on creating small art, but I have some plans on how to throw some small writing into the mix as well.&nbsp; <br /><br /><h3>How to Create Small Art</h3><br /><ul><li>Decide on a medium</li><li>Use a small canvas or paper (4" x 6" or 4" x 4" are good sizes)</li><li>Set a day to start</li><li>Try to finish your art in one day (shooting for doing art that can be finished in less than an hour is ideal).</li></ul><br />Trying to finish in one day means that you may have to avoid complicated subjects that require a ton of details. I have to confess though, my first small painting took me three days! It took so long because I was having a hard time getting what I wanted on the canvas, and I kept making changes. I think this is a normal part of making art, so be gentle with yourself if you find that you're not progressing on a piece like you wish you could.<br /><br />It also took me awhile to figure out what I could paint in under an hour. When my paintings failed to meet my time goals, I finished the painting I was working on and examined what I could do to make my next project simpler.<br /><br />I've seen advice that encourages making artwork featuring your favorite objects when you're first starting out. However, I strongly prefer drawing people over objects. Doing small art of people can be challenging if you're a perfectionist like me. But the following books have helped me let go of my perfectionism and get into drawing people more intuitively and quickly:<br /><br /><ul><li><b>Drawing &amp; Painting Beautiful Faces</b> by Jane Davenport</li><li><b>Creative Girl Mixed Media Techniques for an Artful Life</b> by Danielle Donaldson</li><li><b>Brave Intuitive Painting</b> by Flora Bowley</li></ul><br />I have <b>Fabulous Figures</b> also by Jane Davenport on my wish list. For more about creating small art in general, check out <b>Daily Painting</b> by Carol Marine.<br /><br /><h3>Ideas for Small Writing</h3>Doing small art has inspired me to give small writing some thought. I haven't tried it yet, but when I do, here's how I plan to go about it:<br /><br /><ul><li>Pick a project</li><li>Use an index card</li><li>Set a day to start</li><li>Fill the index card with writing in one day (most likely, I could fill an index card with writing in under an hour).</li></ul>What makes this different from small art is that filling the index card is the goal instead of finishing a project. This makes it a better fit for novels and longer works.<br /><br />Right now, I'm working on multiple projects. I'm too far along with my current short story to give this a try, but the next short comic I have planned would be a good fit.<br /><br />Other projects I think it would be fun to fill an index card with:<br /><br /><ul><li>Flash fiction</li><li>Content for a zine</li><li>Journal entries by characters in one of my stories</li><li>A poetry collection</li><li>Writing separate paragraphs that are all related to one theme</li></ul><br />When I try it, I'll make sure to share how it goes ðŸ˜‰. Overall, creating small has allowed me to create prolifically despite how insanely busy I am, and I find that invigorating and exciting.
