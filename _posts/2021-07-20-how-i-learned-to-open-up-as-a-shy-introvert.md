Lately, I've been writing about [_The INFP Entrepreneur_](https://arcadiapage.com/tags/#Season%201%20INFP%20Entrepreneur). In this post I'm taking a detour from that to share my newest project: **Inner Universe, Outer Worlds**.

**Inner Universe, Outer Worlds** is a 24 page mini-guided journal. I decided to make this journal after reflecting on a time when I felt disconnected from people. Back then I found it frustrating that others could freely share what they enjoyed and cared about. That was something I struggled to do.

I spent some time with my journal, thinking of ways to better share who I am with others. I also came across two books that gave me a different view, **The Quiet Rise of Introverts** by Brenda Knowles and **How to Be Yourself** by Ellen Hendriksen.

As a shy introvert, those two books helped me understand what I needed to think about to find that bridge between my inner life and the outside world. **Inner Universe, Outer Worlds** is full of questions that helped me to show a little more of myself. I also share actions I took to show others what's important to me in a comfortable and authentic way.

As I was putting together this journal, I realized it would be good if I did these prompts again. I've changed a bit, and I feel I've lost touch of the parts of myself I feel safe sharing.

I hope this journal helps introverts to reflect on what's great about their private lives and how to share parts of that with the outside world.
