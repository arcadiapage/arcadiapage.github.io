I'm halfway done with the overall updating process. I'm excited about including new things and simpler methods.<br /><br />First,  when I started writing this book, I was using about four different  programs: Focus Writer, Gdocs, MsWord, and Workflowy. I was also testing  out Zen Writer, Ommwriter, and a host of other minimalist writing  environments. However, there's nothing minimalist about using so many  different programs!<br /><br />Recently I read a book called<a href="https://michael-nobbs-knw5.squarespace.com/library"> Sustainable Creativity by Micheal Nobbs</a>. In his book he said, "Simplicity is the  reduction of choice." <br /><br />This has become my motto, especially as I go though updating my book. <br /><br />I've found that the pickier I am with the digital tools I use, the better.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>This  time around I discovered editing in Zoho Writer and I really love it,  even more than Google Docs. Not only does Zoho Writer has a minimal  interface, but it also has good built-in grammar checking. Now I'm only  using Zoho Writer to edit, and I've let go of the rest. <br /><br />I've  cleaned up my computer, deleting multiple apps that do the same thing  and opting for my favorites. Doing so brings simplicity by reducing  choice. <br /><br />When it comes to the actual book, I am updating for  clarity, conciseness and helpfulness.&nbsp; I'm looking to reduce the number  of options presented in the main text and to share the most straight  forward methods. Everything else will be moved to the appendix. My  favorite part about this change is that the entire book has a more  natural flow. Plus I think the stronger focus on big picture planning  and other techniques that leverage INFP strengths, makes the last few  chapters on using a planner and completing tasks easier to understand.<br /><br />If  you've already purchased the book, no worries. You can re-download the  updated version from the ebook retailer you originally purchased it  from. I hope to have it out within the next two months. However, the updated book is organized quite differently, so I'm not sure how that's going to affect notes and highlighting. <br /><br /><b>Current Writing Tools I Use:</b><br />Midori MD Notebook Line Free <br />Muji Gel Ink Ballpoint Pen in Black<br />Workflowy<br />Zoho Writer<br />Dark Reader Extension for Firefox
