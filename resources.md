âœ¨This page is a living library that will grow and change over time. It will forever be a work in progress...If you notice any broken links, please [email me](mailto:arcadia@arcadiapage.com) so I can fix it!

âœ¨ This page is very different from the [Topics](https://arcadiapage.com/tags/) page on my blog. The [Topics](https://arcadiapage.com/tags/) page only lists articles that I've written on specific subjects. This library is a curated collection of favorite resources I've discovered across the Internet. I only include articles and books I've created if they're relevant to the topic.

âœ¨ Your librarian (That's me...) will leave annotations marked with the heart ðŸ’– symbol on various resources. 

âœ¨ This index page is focused on listing the resouces that I view as **the most essential**. But for categories where I've decided to go more in depth, there is the galaxy ðŸŒŒ symbol next to a link for a full page dedicated to that topic. 

âœ¨ As a library visitor, feel free to leave a comment in the chatbox. If you have more in-depth inquires, sending me an [email](mailto:arcadia@arcadiapage.com) would be better.

ðŸ’– In the commercialism obsessed Internet of today, it's easy to forget that the Internet can also serve as a beautiful canvas for self-expression. There's nothing inherently wrong with commercialism...we have to earn money to live. But the Internet desperately needs thoughtful, hand-crafted spaces to bring things into balance.
