âœ¨This page is a living library that will grow and change over time. It will forever be a work in progress...If you notice any broken links, please let me know in the chat so I can fix it!

âœ¨ This page is very different from the Topics page on my blog. The Topics page only lists articles that I have written on a specific subject. This Library is a curated collection of favorite resources I've discovered across the Internet. I only include articles and books I've created if they're relevant to the topic.

âœ¨ Your librarian (That's me...) will leave annotations marked with the ðŸ’– symbol on various resources. Enjoy!
