      <h1>Welcome to our Privacy Policy</h1>            <h3>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3><p>It is Arcadia Page's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://www.arcadiapage.com">https://www.arcadiapage.com</a> (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://www.arcadiapage.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p>            <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>                        <h2>Website Visitors</h2>            <p>Like most website operators, Arcadia Page collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Arcadia Page's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Arcadia Page's visitors use its website. From time to time, Arcadia Page may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>            <p>Arcadia Page also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://www.arcadiapage.com blog posts. Arcadia Page only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>                                    <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>            <p>Certain visitors to Arcadia Page's websites choose to interact with Arcadia Page in ways that require Arcadia Page to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Arcadia Page gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for email subscriptions at https://www.arcadiapage.com to provide a username and email address.</p>                                    <h2>Security</h2>            <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>                                                <h2>Links To External Sites</h2>            <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.</p>            <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or services.</p>                                                            <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>            <p>Arcadia Page may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. Arcadia Page may display this information publicly or provide it to others.
